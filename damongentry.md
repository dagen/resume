## Overview 
With over 25 years of software development and operational experience, I am looking for a 
position in which I can share my experience in a leadership/mentoring role.  Passionate about 
improving software development capabilities in cross-functional teams, I have experience 
helping organizations in their journey towards an agile transformation. Moving from waterfall 
to agile to continuous integration and delivery involves more than just implementing best 
practices, it involves helping to shape the culture of different teams to understand how they 
can work together to improve both quality and speed of delivery to ensure customer needs are 
met.   Additionally, I have helped teams migrate their runtime environments from on-premises 
to cloud architecture using automation for provisioning, configuration management, and 
monitoring of the platform.
